Polynomial Simplification Project

To test our code, you must enter a single expression with a newline proceeding it. If the 
test filehas the expression on a single line without the newline attached, the error, 
"exception Lexer.Eof" will occur. 

Currently the only thing know to be not working is when there are multiple levels of distribution
This is an example of a distribution that doesn't currently work (x^3+5x*(x^2+1))^2
But with each test in a form similar to (x^2+x+1)^4 the program has been able to solve it
